polymorphism: It is a way of using same code in multiple ways.

There are 2 types of polymorphism:
    1. compile-time polymorphism
          i. constructor overloading
         ii. method overloading
        iii. operator overloading

    2. run-time polymorphism
         i. method overriding

Overloading: When we have something (constructor, method, operator) in the same class and same name but with different parameters

Overriding: When we have something (constructor, method, operator) with same name and same parameters but in different classes (both classes will be inherited)
